========

**A feature-rich library for reimagined calculations.**

Efficalc is designed to transform how engineers approach calculations, moving away from traditional methods like manual spreadsheets and toward a more efficient, accurate, and collaborative engineering calculation process.

Built with the modern engineer in mind, Efficalc leverages the power of Python to offer an **extensible**, **testable**, and **powerful** calculations framework.

Automated Report Generation:
    Automatically create detailed and professional calculation reports for crystal clear reviewing and ambiguity-free submittals.
Open Source:
    Are we missing a feature you wish we had? You can request it or build it into the library yourself so that everyone can benefit from your improvements.
Engineering-Specific Features:
    Out-of-the box helpers for common engineering problems such as a section properties database units display.
Reusability:
    Build your calculation templates once and reuse them across multiple designs and projects.
Build in Any Order:
    Efficalc doesn't lock you into a predefined calculation sequence. Design your calculations in any order that suits your project's needs.
Control Your Content:
    You decide what gets displayed in your calculation reports. This ensures that only relevant information is communicated, making your reports as concise or detailed as you desire.
